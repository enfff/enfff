<h3 align="center">Languages, tools and frameworks</h3>
<!-- which I've used in previous projects   -->

<h4 align="left">Robotics, Control Theory</h4>

- [Sensors, embedded systems and algorithms for Service Robotics](https://github.com/enfff/SESASR): **(work in progress)** Name is self-explicatory -  implemented in ROS2
- [ROS1 Implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/enfff/robot-learning-labs/tree/main/exercise1-ekf-enfff)
- [Nonlinear Control and Aereospace Applications](https://github.com/enfff/NLCAA): **(work in progress)** MATLAB/Simulink implementation of various nonlinear control techniques including Feedback Linearization (FL), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
- [Modeling and Control of a Cyber-Physical System](https://github.com/enfff/cps-project): implementation of a controller with two approaches based on: 1. a distributed neighborhood observer, and 2. local observer; implementation of the iterative threshold-shrinkage operator to solve sparse attacks on sensor measurements and target localization

<h4 align="left">Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning</h4>

- [Data Augmentation techniques for Airbus Ship Detection](https://github.com/enfff/airbus-ship-detection): Using a simple Object Detection task solved via a Faster R-CNN,  we put major emphasis on less-known data augmentation techniques to increase the quality of the predictions, such as Patch Gaussian, and  Fourier transform-based data augmentation
- [Guided Domain Randomization through Adversarial Agent](https://github.com/enfff/rl-hopper): Reinforcement Learning project developed following GAN-like approach over the Hopper, a one-legged robot (Gym environment)
- [QLearning, Policy Gradient methods](https://github.com/enfff/robot-learning-labs/tree/main/exercise3-qlearning-enfff)

<h4 align="left">Other</h4>

- [QuickCapture](https://github.com/enfff/quickcapture-egui): a multiplatform screenshot utility written in Rust
- [Network Dynamics and Learning](https://github.com/enfff/NDL): collection of mini-projects dealing with Network Dynamics, covering topics such as Flow Dynamics, French De-Groot learning models, matchings, Random Graphs, Markov Chains, Epidemic Models
- [Pacman Tamagotchi](https://github.com/enfff/pacman_tamagotchi): videogame developed on an ARM board
